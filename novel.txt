Once upon a time, there lived a monkey named George. He loved playing with his 
friends Big C, and Big C's Wife, Cece. One day, they were playing hide and seek, and 
Big C was the seeker. George hid in the treetops of the rainforest. Cece hid 
in the crystal clear lagoon. 

After twenty seconds of waiting, Big C went out to look for Geroge and Cece. First, he 
checked the the bushes. 

No one was there. 

Next, he checked under the trees. 

No one was there. 

Now, Big C was confused. "Where could they be?" he pondered aloud.
